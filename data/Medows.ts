Even in the wake of the pandemic, GPs and Care Home staff are over worked and desperately crying out for help. We are extremely proud to have created a tool that can help make a difference."

            text: "One of the most important things about Medows is that it is not a replacement for GPs or Care Home staff. Instead, it is a tool to help them communicate better. It provides GPs with a list of patients who have recently had concerns with health, along with observations, medication, and care plan information, which helps them plan their ward rounds and care home visits more efficiently. At the same time, it allows Care Home staff to manage their current residents and provides an overview of the population to aid hospital discharges."

            text: "We have already received a lot of positive feedback from GPs and Care Home staff who are using Medows. Anecdotal data shows that it has helped reduce the number of hospital admissions, and early estimates suggest that it could save the NHS at least Â£19 million per year if it was rolled out nationwide. We believe that this is a conservative estimate and that the actual figure could be much higher."

We hope that Medows will continue to be successful and that it will help GPs and Care Home staff communicate more effectively for years to come."
