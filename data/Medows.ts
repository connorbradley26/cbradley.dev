            text: "One of the most important things about Medows is that it is not a replacement for GPs or Care Home staff. Instead, it is a tool to help them communicate better. It provides GPs with a list of patients who have recently had concerns with health, along with observations, medication, and care plan information, which helps them plan their ward rounds and care home visits more efficiently. At the same time, it allows Care Home staff to manage their current residents and provides an overview of the population to aid hospital discharges."

Anecdotal data shows that it has helped reduce the number of hospital admissions, and early estimates suggest that it could save the NHS at least Â£19 million per year if it was rolled out nationwide. We believe that this is a conservative estimate and that the actual figure could be much higher."
